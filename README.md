# IFYL (If You Liked)

IFYL is a web app that recommends five other songs based on a user's selected song. If you liked a particular song, IFYL can help you discover other songs that you might enjoy.

## How it works

To use IFYL, simply select a song from the dropdown menu on the home page. IFYL will use the Spotify API to recommend five other songs that share similar characteristics.
