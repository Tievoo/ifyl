IFYL (If You Liked) is a web application designed to help users discover new music that matches their preferences. It uses the Spotify API to recommend five other songs that share similar characteristics to a user's selected song.

The idea behind IFYL is to make it easy for users to find new songs that they might enjoy based on their existing preferences. Instead of endlessly searching for new music, users can simply select a song they like and let IFYL do the work for them.

The interface of IFYL is simple and easy to use. Users can select a song from the dropdown menu on the homepage, and IFYL will display a list of five recommended songs. Each recommended song is accompanied by a thumbnail image, the name of the artist, and the name of the song.

To build IFYL, we used React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. These technologies allowed us to create a responsive and easy-to-use interface that works well across different devices and screen sizes.

If you'd like to contribute to IFYL, feel free to open a pull request or submit an issue on the project's GitHub repository. We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels, whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started.

Overall, IFYL is a great tool for anyone who loves discovering new music and wants to make the process of finding new songs more efficient and enjoyable. Give it a try today and see what new music you can discover!
